# Welcome to Concentration!
# The Game of Memory
  
## Objective of the Game
    <ul>
        Collect as many matching pairs of cards as possible!
        If you collect all 6 matching pairs before the timer expires, you win!

## Instructions
    <ol>
        Press the Start Game button, which will activate the 60 second timer.
        Click on two cards, which will turn from face down to face up to reveal an image.
        If the images match, the cards will remain face up and taken out of game play.
        If they do not match, the cards will return face down to be played again.
        Remember the placement of each image!
        If you match all 6 pairs before the 60 second timer expires, you win!
        If you do not match all 6 pairs before the timer expires, you lose and can play again.

<!-- ReadMe Template Worksheet

Your ReadMes are the key deliverable that engineers will want to see as part of your job search. Each engineering team will look at different aspects of your ReadMe and repo. Some will go into the code itself and explore. Others will just want to see the showcase code snippets in the main ReadMe. Some will read the full thing to understand your approach, others will skim to specific sections.

It’s crucial that you cover all the different sections below to ensure that you’ve got the information for all engineers that check these out. 

We regularly have employers discuss the importance of the ReadMes in what they’re looking for and why they interview the grads that they do - so don’t underestimate the importance of writing strong ReadMes! 

For any pair or group project, you cannot share a ReadMe. These must be written independently to ensure that the engineers reading this understands your specific experience and approach. 

It’s a good idea to start your ReadMes during the planning stage as this is the best way to get ahead and save time when it comes to finalising your first draft post-project. As you plan each aspect of your project, note down what you intend to do with screenshots of your plan and anything else you think would be useful, then when you execute this part in your code, you can adjust this part of your ReadMe as needed depending on how your process changed, or if it went as planned then you can leave it as it is.

Make a copy of this document for each project you use throughout the course and fill in each section. 

Once the content has been finalised here, you can then quickly upload these onto your GitHub repository later.




Things To Consider:

That there are no spelling mistakes in your ReadMe - if you see a spelling error highlighted below, edit this. 
Some engineers will reject applicants if their ReadMes are full of mistakes. From their perspective, if your ReadMes are full of mistakes, what is your code like…

That your technologies are capitalised correctly - i.e JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB

That your formatting is consistent throughout - headers, indentation, full stops in bullets etc

Any hyperlink included works

That you include images throughout - code snippets, pictures of your planning stage, screenshots of the final project.
These can be still screenshots or gifs
This breaks up the text in your ReadMe and helps to keep the reader engaged

That your ReadMe sounds like you - see this as an opportunity to showcase who you are to the engineering community and prospective employers. 
Think back to the Personal Brand session and how employers want to get a sense of who you are. The content you write should sound as if you’re talking through your experience.  -->

Insert your Description here: -->

### Description:

    In Week 7 we were asked to create the HTML, CSS and JavaScript of a browser based game. From the list provided, I chose the game of Concentration, also known as Memory, where a player selects from 12 back-facing cards to find 6 matching pairs.  We were required to use DOM manipulation techniques for an interactive experience, and include a win/loss condition, Flexbox or Grid CSS design, and include accessible features such as the WCAG 2.0 level AA color contrast standard and alt text.

    All images on the site have alt text.
    No text is placed on top of an image in a way that makes the text inaccessible.
</ul>


<!-- Planning

Instructions

The planning stage is important, as all projects in your future roles will have detailed plans before any coding happens. It is a great experience to share with potential engineer employers, as this reflects real engineering team practices. 

Start by explaining the initial steps you took in the project. 

Did you do any sketches? If so, discuss this and include images.
Any wireframes of the front end and UI? You did? Then explain this and include images.
Any ERDs? (Entity Relationship Diagram) Same here, explain and include images.
Use a project management tool to plan the sprint? If so, talk through this - what tool did you use? How you allocated tickets/responsibilities, sprint timeline etc. Also include screenshots of this.
Any pseudocode? 
If it was a group or pair project - Discuss who was designated which tasks. This is very important, as engineers want to understand who owned the different code elements when looking at a group project.

For each project, review the above bullets and discuss every step you took in the planning stage, including the relevant images.

Not every project will include the above, but it’s important to discuss any of the bullets that you did implement.

    #### User Story:

As a user, I want to see a landing page when I arrive at the 
website to know I'm in the right place. 

As a user, I want to see instructions and the intial set up of 
the game.  

As a user, I want to start the game and have the capability to click on two cards to flip them over.

As a user, I want the computer to show me the front of the 
cards, and then determine if the card images are the same:

    If the card images are the same, they are a match, and taken 
out of game play. 
    If the card images are different, then they are returned to 
the face down position to be played again. 

As a user, I want to know if I've won or lost the game.  

As a user, I want to be able to continue to click on two cards until there are no more matching 
pairs, or until the timer is expired and the game is over. 

As a user, I want to know if I've won the game and have the option to play 
another round. 

Misc: Colors/ images on cards will have the appropriate contrast 
to meet the WCAG 2.0 level AA standard. 

All images will have alt text 

Theme: Images will likely be of animals. 

    Pseudocode

Pseudocode 
1) Welcome to Concentration! 
2) Objective of the Game
        ul
3) Instructions 
        ol

Game Set up in HTML: 
    <Div> 
    <cardBacks added to HTML per Usmans guidance>

Gameboard:
    Flexbox with 12 boxes

4) Create 12 playing cards, 6 pairs with matching images on the 
front, and each with the same exact backside image.
cardFront - 6 animal images, each assigned to 2 cards (let cardPair)
cardBack - barn image 
    Variable array of 6 images (cardFronts)

5) The computer shuffles the cards, and places them face down in 
        random order. 
    
        Per Joe: Shuffling: 
    Google how to shuffle/randomize my array 
    Okay to use Fisher Yates shuffle algorithym (Okay this took some work/googling/ research)

    
6) Click on Start Game button, which sets timer & randomizes the cardFronts.

7) Only two cards can be clicked per turn, at which time a matchedPair if/else function is called.

    IF/ THEN functions: 
8) IF they are a match, THEN the cards are kept face up 

9) IF they are not a match, THEN they are returned face down,  

10) If all 6 pairs are matched before the 60 second timer expires, You Win!

11) If the timer expires before all 6 pairs are matched, you lose and can play again by clicking the Start Game button.

12) Win/loss condition:
    Timer? (code from Stack Overflow dot com)
    Max numClicks?

CACHED ELEMENTS: 
CONST - Start Game button

EVENT LISTENERS: 
handle Click for two cards
handle Click reset/Start Game button


handleClicks:
    Max two clicks per turn before If/Else runs to match the cards and determine if a matched pair was made.

document query selector to obtain the image of the clicked card

 if/else
    to determine if the click is the 1st click or the 2nd click

if/else
    if document query selector of the ${first card} source equals to the ${second card} source,

    then numClicks resets to 0 so the game can continue
    matchedPairs is called

Compare cardPairs to determine if they are a match with event.target.parentElement.id
    
    else
    
    The setTimer function is called to flip the cards back to cardBack in 2 seconds
    and setAttribute method is used to return both cards back to the cardBack image

    and numClicks is reset back to 0

if matchedPairs === 6 within the 60 second game timer, the message "You Win!"" appears

If matchedPairs does not equal (!=) 6 within the 60 second timer, the player loses and they are offered to play again. 


Reset function sets the matchedPairs and numClicks back to 0 and blanks out the message (message being the timer and win/loss condtion)

Then,
The Fisher Yates suffle function is called to randomize the cardFronts when the Start Game button is clicked. 



<!-- Build/Code Process

Instructions

The Build/Code Process will be the longest section of your ReadMe and will be most insightful to the engineers that review them. This is where you will discuss the steps you took to code the project.

You want to see your ReadMes as a way to walk the engineers through your approach and problem solving from the start of the project through to the end.

You'll need to include a minimum of 3-4 code snippets, highlighting code you're particularly proud of and these code snippets will have descriptions on what you did, how and why to set the context of the snippet you include. These explanations are important for the engineers, as they will want to understand what you did and the reasoning behind the steps you took.

You don't need to document every single thing you coded, but walk them through the key sections of the project build.

For any group project, you will just focus on your contributions. 

Some people will document the build/code process by discussing the key stages they worked on. Others will do a day by day guide. It’s entirely up to you how you structure this, as long as you discuss all the key things above.

Insert your Build/Code Process here: -->


### Build/Code Process

Professor Usman started assisting me with the following code:

const targetImage = document.querySelector(`#${event.target.parentElement.id} img`)

Assistant Professor Joe assisted by giving me the array breakdown to be able to assign 6 images twice with the cardPair variable.

Assistant Professor Joe suggested the Fisher Yates shuffle function to randomize the card

From there I was able to re-read the course notes, review code from previous lectures and labs, google, two additional text books from the library: 
    (JavaScript A Beginners Guide by John Pollock
    JavaScript by Mike McGrath)

    and just try about a million things and jumbled together this mess. 


<!-- Challenges

Instructions

Challenges are great for showing your learning journey and problem solving, and this is a section that many engineers will check out. Every day of your engineering career you’ll encounter challenges, this is part of your growth and development. It’s the challenges you encounter that helps you become a stronger and more competent engineer. 

Here you will detail any particular challenges you encountered as you were coding the project. 

Questions to answer here:

What technical challenges did you come across? 
Why were these challenges? 
What problem solving did you do to rectify them?
Team dynamics/ Project management
Tools/Tech you used

Insert your Challenges here: -->


### Challenges:

Every single thing. 
Especially this:

let id = event.target.parentElement.id.substring(4)

and this from the randomize function:
        let temp = cards[i]; 
        cards[i] = cards[index];
        cards[index] = temp;

<!-- Wins

Instructions

The Wins section is your opportunity to highlight the aspects of your project you are most proud of. See this as your chance to showcase these parts of your projects to the engineers reading your ReadMes.

Things you could discuss here:

Interesting problem solving you did
Strong sections of code
Collaboration with other team members
Visual design of the project

### Wins:

Completing the game


<!-- Key Learnings/Takeaways

Instructions

This section is one of the other most important parts of your ReadMe from an engineers’ perspective and helps to differentiate each of you from your classmates and team members. 

Engineers love to understand what you learn from each project and how it has shaped you as an engineer. 

See this as your opportunity to show the engineers how your skills grew during each project sprint. 

Things you could discuss here:

What Technologies/Tools do you now feel more confident with? Tell them specifically what you learnt about these. 
What engineering processes did you become more comfortable with? Standups? Pair programming? Project management? Tell them what you learnt from these processes?

Insert your Key Learnings/Takeaways here: -->

### Key Learnings/ Takeaways:

Everything was a key learning experience.
Takeaways: try everything

<!-- Bugs

Instructions

If you have any bugs in your project, it’s important that you flag them in your ReadMe. This helps the engineers reviewing your projects to understand that you are aware that there are issues - if you don’t flag these, then they won’t have that visibility that you know these problems are in your code and it can result in them not having a full understanding of your technical knowledge. 

In either sentences or bullets, explain what the bugs are.

If you have no bugs, you can leave this section blank.

Insert your Bugs here: -->

### Bugs:

The images do not fit fully in their boxes.
If the game is played too quickly, the cards flip incorrectly.


<!-- Future Improvements

Instructions

It’s common to get to the end of your project and have ideas on what you would do if you have more time, as well as how you might improve it. 

If you do, you should detail this here. It’s great to give that context on potential future improvements, to share your creative or technical ideas with the engineers reading your ReadMes.

In either sentences or bullets, explain what your future improvements would be.

Insert your Future Improvements here: -->

### Future Improvements:

Fix card sizes to fit perfectly in their boxes
Fix timer.
Add 2nd player.
Add more cards.
